* 1.18

	Ignore the DBI error for last_insert_id and default to undef

	Fixed a bug in SINGLE if returned_rows = 0 it will not return undef, but give us blank rows!
	Documentation tweaks

* 1.12

	In the SubProcess, added a binmode() to STDIN and STDERR, for the windows attempt
	Added code to make SimpleDBI work in Win32 boxes, thanks to the recent Wheel::Run patches!
	Documentation tweaks as usual

* 1.11

	Hannes had a problem:
		His IRC bot logs events to a database, and sometimes there is no events to log after
		hours and hours of inactivity ( must be a boring channel haha ), the db server disconnected!

	The solution was to do a $dbh->ping() before each query, if your DBI driver does it inefficiently, go yell at them!
	In the event that a reconnect is not possible, an error will be sent to the CONNECT event handler, look at the updated pod.
